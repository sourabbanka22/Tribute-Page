          Few Quotes by Albert Einstein:
          <div>
            Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.<br>
            Imagination is more important than knowledge.<br>
            Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
